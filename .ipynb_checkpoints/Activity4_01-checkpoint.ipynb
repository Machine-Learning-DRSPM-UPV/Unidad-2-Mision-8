    "# Activity 4.01: Car Data Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will build a reliable decision tree model that's capable of aiding a company in finding cars that clients are likely to buy. We will be assuming that the car rental agency is focusing on building a lasting relationship with its clients. Your task is to build a decision tree model that classifies cars into one of four categories: unacceptable, acceptable, good, and very good.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > The dataset for this activity can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation). Citation â€“ Dua, D., & Graff, C.. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "  \n",
    "It is composed of six different features: `buying`, `maintenance`, `doors`, `persons`, `luggage_boot`, and `safety`. The target variable ranks the level of acceptability for a given car. It can take four different values: `unacc`, `acc`, `good`, and `vgood`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > **Hints**  \n",
    "  >  * Load the dataset into Python and import the necessary libaries.\n",
    "  >  * Perform label encoding with `LabelEncoder()` from scikit-learn.\n",
    "  >  * Extract the `label` variable using `pop()` from pandas.\n",
    "  >  * Separate the training and testing data with `train_test_spit()` from scikit-learn. We will use 10% of the data as test data. With `random_state=88`.\n",
    "  >  * Build the decision tree classifier using `DecisionTreeClassifier()` and its methods, `fit()` and `predict()`.\n",
    "  >  * Check the score of our model based on the test data with score().\n",
    "Create a deeper evaluation of the model using `classification_report()` from scikit-learn.\n",
